# X-Ray Single-Photon Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy

# Running the code
Example code to analyse an image and create a spectrum is provided in [`example_usage.ipynb`](example_usage.ipynb).

# Project brief:
Write a software suite that can process 2D spectroscopy data collected in a generic XSPEDS experiment, using both Bragg diffraction and single photon counting, and return a spectrum (photon intensity as a function of photon energy) with optimized signal-to-noise and optimized spectral resolution. Uncertainty on the photon number must be provided.
